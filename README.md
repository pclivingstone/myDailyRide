This repo contains R code.  To run it, you will need:
- to have installed R and RStudio,
- cloned this repo,
- have a copy of the data downloaded and stored it locally (it is NOT in the repo)
- run the code in main.R

This will create some png files in the project directory, print some stuff to screen
and draw an interactive network graph.
